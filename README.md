# fragxpress - analyzing nucleic acid electropherograms

* Goals: 
    - follow the processing steps during generation of an NGS library
    - analyze topoisomer distributions from CQ-assisted plasmid topoisomer 
      separation

* TODO
    - parse AATI electropherograms, exported via ProSize
    - ladder database
    - peak detection 
    - baseline subtraction
